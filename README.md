# KE-from-Indian-Languages
This repository contains the documents and stopword lists for English language and three Indian languages - Bengali, Hindi, and Marathi.

The data can be used to extract keywords in the four langauges. Articles with id '2142' and '2148' are from Hulth2003 dataset, which are originally written in English. Both articles are translated to the three Indian languages using Google Translate. Articles on topics 'animation' and 'covid19' are Wikipedia articles written in the four languages.

Stopword lists are downloaded from Stopwords ISO (Link: https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-iso) and later updated to include more keywords in the three Indian languages.
